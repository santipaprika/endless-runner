# Endless Runner

## Description
Unity-based endless runner, i.e. the player runs automatically and the user's job is to jump to the platforms that will be randomly generated (limited specific randomness to avoid inconsistencies) to avoid falling.  
Additionally, some obstacles and enemies may appear. To avoid them, the user has to jump as well. See the video demo below for a better understanding.
